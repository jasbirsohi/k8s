# How to set alias for kubectl
alias k=kubectl

# Setting the namespace preference:

# Note: 
# 1. You can permanently save the namespace for all subsequent kubectl commands in that context.
# 2. --minify=false: Remove all information not used by current-context from the output

# Syntax: 
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=<insert-namespace-name-here>
# Provided alias k=kubectl is set else type full syntax as kubectl
k config set-context --current --namespace=dev
k config view --minify | grep namespace:
k get pods

# Imperative method to provision httpd apache application
# Provided alias k=kubectl is set

# Create namespace dev
k create ns dev
# Check if any exisiting pods are present in newly created namespace which is dev
k get po -n=dev
# To Check the pods current status in all namespaces
kubectl get pods -A
# If we need to create just 01 pod only 
k run httpd1 --image=httpd -n=dev
k get po -n=dev

# If we need to create deployment of httpd (Apache Server)
k create deploy httpd1 --image=httpd --replicas=3 -n=dev
k get po -n=dev
# To check the Pods Status on cluster wide ndes
k get po -n=dev -o wide
# to see yaml output you cam try below command
k get po -n=dev -o yaml
# Exposing Service through NodePort 80 without selectors 
k expose deploy httpd1 --type=NodePort --port=80 -n=dev


# Deleting Imperative Commands

# First delete the svc 
k delete svc httpd1 -n=dev
# Second delete pods deployment
k delete deploy httpd1 -n=dev
# Delete if you have any standalone pod made without deployment method
k get po -A
k get po -n=dev
k delete po httpd

# If you willing to delete dev namespace in the end
k get ns
k delete ns dev
k get ns
k get po

# Imperative method to provision nginx application
# Provided namespace is still dev

# Check if any exisiting pods are present in newly created namespace which is dev

# To Check the pods current status in all namespaces

# Certification Tips – Imperative Commands with Kubectl
# While you would be working mostly the declarative way – using definition files, imperative commands can help in getting one time tasks done quickly, as well as generate a definition template easily. This would help save considerable amount of time during your exams.

# Before we begin, familiarize with the two options that can come in handy while working with the below commands:

# --dry-run: By default as soon as the command is run, the resource will be created. If you simply want to test your command , use the --dry-run=client option. This will not create the resource, instead, tell you whether the resource can be created and if your command is right.

# -o yaml: This will output the resource definition in YAML format on screen.

# Use the above two in combination to generate a resource definition file quickly, that you can then modify and create resources as required, instead of creating the files from scratch.


# POD
# Create an NGINX Pod
kubectl run nginx --image=nginx
# Generate POD Manifest YAML file (-o yaml). Don’t create it(–dry-run)
kubectl run nginx --image=nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml 

# Deployment
# Create a deployment
kubectl create deployment --image=nginx nginx
# Generate Deployment YAML file (-o yaml). Don’t create it(–dry-run) and export the yaml contents to nginx-deployment.yaml
kubectl create deployment --image=nginx nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml > nginx-deployment.yaml
# Generate Deployment with 4 Replicas
kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx --replicas=4
# You can also scale a deployment using the kubectl scale command.
kubectl scale deployment nginx --replicas=4 
# Another way to do this is to save the YAML definition to a file and modify
kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml > nginx-deployment.yaml
# You can then update the YAML file with the replicas or any other field before creating the deployment.

# Service
# Create a Service named redis-service of type ClusterIP to expose pod redis on port 6379
kubectl expose pod redis --port=6379 --name redis-service --dry-run=client -o yaml
# (This will automatically use the pod’s labels as selectors)

# Or

kubectl create service clusterip redis --tcp=6379:6379 --dry-run=client -o yaml 
# (This will not use the pods labels as selectors, instead it will assume selectors as app=redis. You cannot pass in selectors as an option. So it does not work very well if your pod has a different label set. So generate the file and modify the selectors before creating the service)

 

# Create a Service named nginx of type NodePort to expose pod nginx’s port 80 on port 30080 on the nodes:
kubectl expose pod nginx --type=NodePort --port=80 --name=nginx-service --dry-run=client -o yaml

# (This will automatically use the pod’s labels as selectors, but you cannot specify the node port. You have to generate a definition file and then add the node port in manually before creating the service with the pod.)

# Or
kubectl create service nodeport nginx --tcp=80:80 --node-port=30080 --dry-run=client -o yaml
# (This will not use the pods labels as selectors)

# Both the above commands have their own challenges. While one of it cannot accept a selector the other cannot accept a node port. I would recommend going with the `kubectl expose` command. If you need to specify a node port, generate a definition file using the same command and mIf you can't explain it simply you don't understand it well enoughanually input the nodeport before creating the service.

# Filter the pods by choosing selectors
# For example your have labels like Environment env=prod,businessunit like bu=finance and tier like tier=frontend
# Filtering through multiple labels
kubectl get po --selector env=prod,bu=finance,tier=frontend
# Filtering through singular labels
kubectl get pods --selector env=dev
kubectl get all --selector env=prod
# If you want to see the pods filtering through selecting labels
kubectl get all --selector env=prod --no-headers
# If you want to count the pods filtering through selecting labels
kubectl get pods --selector env=dev --no-headers | wc -l

# When you want to remove the taint from control plane use (-) to remove the taint
kubectl taint no controlplane node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane:NoSchedule-

kubectl taint no node01 spray=mortein:NoSchedule

kubectl label no node01 color=blue

# To view Daemonsets in all namespaces
kubectl get ds --all-namespaces

# to examine Daemonset For example
kubectl describe daemonset kube-flannel-ds --namespace=kube-flannel

# To view all objects in all namespaces
kubectl get all  --all-namespaces
